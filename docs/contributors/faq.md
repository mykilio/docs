# FAQ

A collection of frequently asked questions regarding the project.

## Why are your README files so empty?

We strive to create a single source of truth within the [`mykilio/docs`][repo-docs] repository. To achieve this we need to actively restrict the scattering of information and create a common point of reference for any information associated with this project. Cutting the README files short is a part of the strategy and we believe that this will help us to reduce the amout of outdated documentation.
